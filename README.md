## Step 4: Make a task list

_Great job adding a code example to the file :partying_face:_

**What is a _task list_?** A task list creates checkboxes to check off. They're very useful for tracking issues and pull requests. If you include a task list in the body of an issue or pull request, you'll see a progress indicator in your issue list. The syntax for task lists is very specific. Be sure to include the spaces where required, or else they won't render.

### Example

```
- [x] List syntax is required
- [x] This item is complete
- [ ] This item is not complete
```

#### How it looks

- [x] List syntax is required
- [x] This item is complete
- [ ] This item is not complete

### :keyboard: Activity: Add a task list

The former hosted course bots are archived. Work on your local learner branch and use `.ci/local.sh` to check your Markdown; course progress changes are manual.

1. Return to your pull request.
1. Use Markdown to create a task list. Here is an example:

   ```md
   - [ ] Turn on GitHub Pages
   - [ ] Outline my portfolio
   - [ ] Introduce myself to the world
   ```

   Remember, a task list starts with the syntax `- [ ]` and then the task list item. The formatting is specific!

1. Use the **Preview** tab to check your Markdown formatting.
1. Commit the changes to the file.
1. Run `bash .ci/local.sh --step 4 --file /path/to/your/index.md` locally. It checks the original task-list predicate without editing course state or using GitHub Actions. Update your course progress manually after it passes.
